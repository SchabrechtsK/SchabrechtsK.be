  We’ve all had the feeling before. You come home from work and even though you did a lot you feel like you got nowhere.<br /> So why are you feeling like this? Most likely you have been busy but not very productive.
</p>

  To fully understand why we feel this way we need to have a look at both definitions. I’ve taken the definition of the <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://www.dictionary.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="http://www.dictionary.com/">dictionary site</a>.
</p>

<blockquote id="76f7" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">
  <p>
    <strong class="markup--strong markup--pullquote-strong">Productivity<br /> </strong>The quality, state, or fact of being able to generate, create, enhance, or bring forth goods and&nbsp;services
  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote id="a9d5" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--pullquote">
  <p>
    <strong class="markup--strong markup--pullquote-strong">Busyness<br /> </strong> Lively but meaningless activity.
  </p>
</blockquote>

  As you can see there is a clear difference between the two. With productivity you bring forth goods or services of a certain quality and usability.<br /> On the other hand we have busyness which indicates that you are in fact doing something, but the act itself is totally meaningless.
</p>

<p id="28eb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
  Now the degree to which we see an action as productive or plain busyness depends highly on the context in which we perform said action.<br /> For example, as a developer it is productive for me to work on the application that has an upcoming deadline. We’re making progress on the goods. Yet, if I were to clean-up my projects I would consider that to be busy. Sure, I’m doing something but it does not contribute to the upcoming deadline. It is thus a meaningless activity at that point.
</p>

<p id="c95c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
  EDIT: I got a few questions about the cleaning part. With “cleaning up my projects” I actually meant cleaning up the general workspace. Refactoring, as mentioned on Twitter, is in my eyes a valid productive action. This is also pure as an example.
</p>

  So a big part of the whole productive vs busy argument lies in the eye of the beholder. This means that if you have this bad feeling on a regular basis try to look at what you’re doing and define if, for you, in which categories your actions fall. Next try to adjust your schedule to it. Give it a shot, who knows you might feel a lot more productive.
