While you were waiting for the “perfect” moment, time, idea or whatever, you have let wonderful, amazing, super and even good enough just let you pass by.

It could have been magical or even the best new thing out there. But you let it slip past while waiting for that “perfect” status.

When you wait to long and you’ll figure out that “perfect” will never be you will feel a lot of guilt, regret and dismay.

So forget “perfect”, nothing is. Write and publish that post, make that art, write that code, ask that person out. Just go for it.<br /> It doesn’t have to be long or beautiful, of great quality or all romantic. Just do it and thinks will work out for themselves. Trust me.
