So yesterday I talked about Atom.io in [this post]({{< ref "2016-04-18-atom-io.md" >}} "Atom.io").  
And as promised today I will give you a list of handy packages that I use in overal for my PHP and webdevelopment.

## Packages

### Highlight Line

The [highlight line](https://atom.io/packages/highlight-line "Highlight Line Homepage") package does as it’s name implies. It will highlight the entire line your cursor is on. This is mostly a visual aid.

### Highlight Selected

With [this package](https://atom.io/packages/highlight-selected "Highlight Selected Homepage") you can easily identify a word or a variable that is selected in the rest of the file. This visual aid will make it easier to debug code.

### Open Recent

This is a pretty standard package that is actually missing from the core. The community of course looked after this by creating [this post](https://atom.io/packages/open-recent "Open Recent Homepage") to solve this problem.

### Atom Beautify

If you ever need an auto formatter than [this is the package](https://atom.io/packages/atom-beautify "Atom Beautify Homepage") you’re looking for. Compatible with HTML, CSS, Javascript and more it is by far the easiest way to format a file on the fly.

### Expose

[The expose package](https://atom.io/packages/expose "Atom Expose Homepage") is more a package for visual aid. It will take all your open tabs and display them in an expose style, hence the name.

### Pigments

[Pigment](https://atom.io/packages/pigments "Atom Pigments Homepage") is a handy little package that will aid you in your css color adventures.

### HTML Editing

For the editing of html you have two decent options.  
[The first package](https://atom.io/packages/autocomplete-html-entities "Atom Autocomplete HTML Entities Homepage") will autocomplete your html tag while [the second package](https://atom.io/packages/autoclose-html "Atom Autoclose HTML Homepage") will auto close the tag. Together they form the base of any good html editor.

### Auto Detect Indentation

Don’t you just hate it when indentation of code is not working as it should. Well [this package](https://atom.io/packages/auto-detect-indentation "Atom Auto Detect Indentation Homepage") will make life and reading the code a whole lot easier.

### PHP Auto Complete

Aside from the html editing there is also a [PHP auto-complete package](https://atom.io/packages/atom-autocomplete-php "Atom PHP Autocomplete Homepage"). This is definitely the basic for editing PHP files.

### Symfony

Symfony is one of the main frameworks that I work with. For this I have found 2 packages that come in handy.  
[The first package](https://atom.io/packages/atom-symfony2 "Atom Symfony2 Homepage") will provide a bunch of tools and auto completion. This mainly on classes and services.  
[The second package](https://atom.io/packages/symfony-snippets) provides snippets based on Symfony development.

### Git

I’ve also found two useful packages for working with git directly in Atom itself.  
[The time-travel package](https://atom.io/packages/git-time-machine "Atom GIT Time Machine Homepage") will let you, as the name implies, see the history of a file.  
[The other package](https://atom.io/packages/merge-conflicts "Atom GIT Merge Conflicts Homepage") will assist you in case of merge conflicts.

### Linter

First you need to install the [base linter package](https://atom.io/packages/linter "Atom Linter Homepage"). From there you can add linters as you wish, f.ex. [CSS](https://atom.io/packages/linter-csslint "Atom CC Linter Homepage"), [Javascript](https://atom.io/packages/linter-jshint "Atom JS Linter Homepage"), [PHP](https://atom.io/packages/linter-php "Atom PHP Linter Homepage") and even [Twig](https://atom.io/packages/linter-twig "Atom Twig Linter Homepage").

### ToDo 

We’ve all done it. Adding a todo but not putting them in our issue tracker. These are just small insignificant todo’s that we tend to lose sight of. With [the Todo Show package](https://atom.io/packages/todo-show "Atom Todo Show Package") you can call up a list of all todo’s within either your project or your open files.

## Theme

### Seti

[Seti](https://atom.io/themes/seti-ui "Atom Seti UI Theme Homepage") is a subtle dark theme for Atom that renders nice icons to to each of your files. In combination with the syntax theme [Seti](https://atom.io/themes/seti-syntax "Atom Seti Syntax Homepage")you get a beautiful view for coding.

## Conlusion

So definitely check these out, install them and try them out. They’ll be worth your while to improve development using Atom.io.
