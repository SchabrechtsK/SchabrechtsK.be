  Last wednesday I woke up and saw the following on my instagram through the <a class="markup--user markup--p-user" href="https://medium.com/u/c4ec9163657c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://medium.com/u/c4ec9163657c" data-anchor-type="2" data-user-id="c4ec9163657c" data-action-value="c4ec9163657c" data-action="show-user-card" data-action-type="hover">Gary Vaynerchuk</a> stories:

  I normally never do any of these but gave it a shot nonetheless. This gave me the following result:
</p>

  I tried to fill it in as honestly as possible. The conclusion was that I was super thankful for the life I can live. All the mistakes I make are mine and I love giving back to the community.

  But the top two might surprise you. Even though I dwell more I still think I’m focused. And that is what I want to go deeper into in this article.
</p>

<p id="a0dc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
  The check on focusing is mostly applied to my work for my clients. Whenever something new comes in I’m pumped and cannot wait to start on it. Hence the focusing.
</p>

<p id="dcc6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
  But then why the dwelling you might ask? My own projects do not get the same level of attention as my client work. I’m talking about the ideas that I have for applications and websites, this blog, my social media and the idea of starting a vlog.
</p>

<p id="a034" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
  All of these get send to the backlog. Instead when I have time to do these I start dwelling on my ideas. This makes it that I start consuming more and more articles instead of working on something.
</p>

<p id="ade2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
  This is what we call the <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">consumer mindset</strong>. Instead of being an active maker in the world the people with the consumer mindset will only consume.<br /> This can range from articles to books, from movies to instagram stories, from vlogs to music.
</p>

<p id="1fcd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
  This does not mean having a consumer mindset is a bad thing however. It purely depends on what you want to achieve in live.<br /> I, for one, am someone with a lot of dreams and ambition. But they are currently not mapped to my actions.
</p>

<p id="8930" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
  So I have to develop a <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">producer mindset</strong>. A producer is someone who will create. Wether it be art, music, movies, applications, websites or something else. The possibilities are endless.
</p>

<blockquote id="034f" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">
  <p>
    The beauty about being a producer is you sit there, and you explore ideas which become a passion, which slowly becomes a reality. — <em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Michelle Yeoh</em>

<p id="16e2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">
  This quote tells it well. I want my ideas to become more than that. I want them to become passions and in the end reality.
</p>

<p id="b3a3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">
  Does this mean we have to give up on consuming? Not at all, but there needs to be a well thought out balance between the two.<br /> Only consuming will give you no results. But only producing will keep you in the dark for new information.
</p>

<p id="b648" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">
  Think about wether you are a consumer or a producer. Is this what you really want of do you want to redefine the balance between the two?
